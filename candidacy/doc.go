/*
Package candidacy provides functions that generate sequences of all possible
variants or normalization of a given input string.

An example use case for this subpackage is an ability to strip out potential
prefixed and suffixed titles from an input string containing full name of a
person while still accounting for the nuanced fact that prefixes and suffixes
of some legitimate names may coincide with some prefixed titles.
