// Package candidate provides functions which generate a sequence
// of all possible variants of a given input string.
//
// An example use case for this subpackage includes an ability to strip out all
// possible prefixed and suffixed titles in the name string of a person (while
// still accounting for that fact that some legitimate names may contain parts
// which coincide with common prefixed and suffixed titles).
